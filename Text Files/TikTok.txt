<h3>YouTube Ads (Case Study)</h3>
Since YouTube works in a similar 'snappy' manner when it comes to advertising,
we researched their types of ads, along with their marketing benefits and uses:

1. Skippable Ads: best known for their 5-second skip button
a. Called “pre-roll” when at the beginning and “mid-roll” when in the middle
b. Advertisers don’t get charged unless the user watches past the
first 5 seconds or if they click on the ad. This is called <strong>TrueView</strong>.

2. Sponsored ads (Liam)
a. The classic NordVPN, Squarespace, Skillshare, or Brilliant ads that are in-video
b. There isn’t a centralized list of brands willing to partner with your channel.
YouTubers either reach out to companies in their niche or become large enough to receive offers from companies.

3. Non-Skippable Ads
a. 76% of people have come to automatically skip ads,
b. Some advertisers decide to make ads short to become non-skippable (usually 15
seconds, or 20 in places like India, Malaysia, Mexico, and Singapore).
c. They do this when they want to raise awareness and are confident enough to
keep you engaged for the full ad.
d. Advertisers pay per <strong>impression</strong>, which is measured in <strong>cost per mile (CPM)</strong> and is
a metric used to quantify the number of digital views or engagements of a piece of content.

4. Bumper Ads
i. Usually 6 seconds, snappy and catchy
ii. Also charged per impression
iii. Can be pre-, mid-, or post-rolls
iv. Best for reach and awareness campaigns

5. Discovery ads
Appear as videos related to whatever you search, and 

6. Non-video ads 
Appear on the side or as a video overlay for small companies,

PROBLEM
<h2>“How might we make interactions with advertisements feel more <strong>organic</strong> and <strong>transparent</strong>?”</h2>

Keeping these points in mind...
    “Influencers aren’t always honest when something is an ad.” (top-left)
    “Transparency.” (top-middle)
    "Since videos on TikTok are really short, I usually don’t understand what they’re promoting." (top-right)
    “Ads should feel more natural.” (bottom-left)
    "I just don't want to leave the app to learn more about a product." (bottom-mid)
    "I wish ads were more like a conversation, not a pitch."

SOLUTION
<h1>AdAssistant</h1>
AI-powered chatbot that makes ads make sense.

Advertisers aim for ads that are short and impressionable, meaning they must omit details.<br>
How would you learn more about the product if you were interested?<br>
<strong>AdAssistant</strong> is the answer. It would be a primary source of information.

FEATURES
Through user testing, we realized that AdAssistant

    Accessibility
AdAssistant questions and answers work with both speech and type.
vid.TikTok_Voice

    Ease of Use
Suggested questions are included and answers are short. 
Entering and exiting AdAssistant is also a swipe away.

    Consistency
Using a overlay pop-up screen blends it with the interface and allows for easy navigation into 
and out of the AdAssistant. Revisiting the ad becomes easy this way.

TAKEAWAYS
Understood what good mockups entail: a good experience. It's not about getting as close to the final product as possible but creatively designing minimal yet interactive experiences that emphasize the most important features.
Experienced working with a social media giant; I better understand their values. I also gained a better idea of why things are designed the way they are (I notice more!)<br>
Learned how to quickly make high-fidelity mockups.<br>
Worked with a diverse group of people (i.e. Marketing, Journalism, Sociology, Design, Biology majors)<br>

RESPONSIBILITIES
Developing 1 of 4 initial mockups<br>
Researching YouTube as a case study<br>
Conducting User Testing<br>
Pitching presentation to TikTok<br>
User Experience (UX) design<br>

PROCESS
<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
We brainstormed ways to empower users to learn about products while incentivizing companies to advertise credibly, honestly, and clearly.
In the process, we came up with four initial mockups:

01. Reaction Redesign
Alert users that they are watching an advertisement, by changing the icons' colors.
img.TikTok_Reaction_Redesign_Mock

02. Critic Mode
For users to engage with ads more consciously while providing advertisers reliable feedback.
img.TikTok_Critic_Mode_Mock
    (Hover)
Switching to critic mode prompts users to answer straightforward questions about ads they watch. 
The time they spend in critic mode guarantees the same amount of time ad-free.

03. Friend-Endorsed Ads
Friends can recommend ads to people they think would like it.

04. AdAssistant
Primary source of information for viewers with questions.
img.TikTok_Ad_Assistant_Mock

After receiving feedback, we decided to move forward with AdAssistant, as it had the most potential and was the most <em>orthogonal</em>.

USER TESTING
We drew a screen on a glass door and enacted the chat-bot experience.
Three college students used it.
We showed them four types of ads: healthcare, food, tech, and makeup, and we wanted to see:
- How would they interact with the chat-bot?
- What type of ads would they use it for?
- What questions would they ask?

SECOND PROTOTYPE
Based on our results, we designed our second prototype with the folling features:
- Closing AdAssistant takes users back to the ad they were viewing. (first-right)
- A translucent background lets the user see the original advertisement. (second-left)
- TikTok colors were used throughout for seamless interface integration. (third-left)
- Accommodates speech and type (forth right)

For our final prototype, we conducted further interface research to most seamlessly integrate
AdAssistant into the app, and considered the following questions:</h3>
- What are the <strong>most common questions</strong>?
- How would the <strong>type of ad</strong> change them?
- How should AdAssistant <strong>display</strong> answers?

FINAL WIREFRAME
The final high-fidelity prototype was created on <strong>Figma</strong> (the snippets above are the result of what's this wireframe!).
