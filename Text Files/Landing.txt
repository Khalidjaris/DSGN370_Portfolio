<h1>Me in ~15 Seconds</h1>
<p><em>adjective – eternal, everlasting, immortal</em></p>

<p>I play the piano, write, study engineering, and take the more 'interesting' route whenever I can.<br>
I prefer running over walking and I carry a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V3HT9JG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details'>
mini notebook</a> everywhere I go. I also love to listen to people's stories.<br>
Saudi Arabian native, I studied in Jordan for three years and now study at Northwestern University in the US.</p>
<p>–––––</p>
<p>Authenticity means approaching everything with an <em>open mind</em>, a burning <em>curiosity</em>, and a relentless <em>desire to inspire</em>. It is my discipline.
<p>I practice various schools of thought to be versatile.</p>
<p>I unlearn frameworks to be creative.</p>
<p>–––––</p>
<p>The future doesn't worry me because I'm certain that, no matter where I end up, I will be carving worlds for people to see.</p>
<p>How I do so doesn't matter.</p>
