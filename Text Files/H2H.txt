PROBLEM

How can we make it easy, accessible, and enjoyable to help while educating people?

We read demoralizing headlines daily and often want to help but don't know how to.
- img.h2h-headlines.png

We tried to help, but our experience went something like that of Stephen below:

1. Stephen returns home and ponders what he can do to help.
2. Eager to do something, he jumps to his computer and begins searching.
3. He is bedazzled by the availability of options!
4. And finds one he likes...
5. So far so good.
6. ––
7. And a barrage of obstacles come his way!
8. He grows frustrated.<br> But he finds a glimmer of hope in a what seems to be a promising website.
9. Only to find a long form on the other side.
10. But he does it anyways, knowing that it’s for a good cause.
11. Weeks fly by.
12. And he droops despondently into his chair...

PAIN POINTS
We realized that:
- It is challenging to find ways to help without making <strong>monetary</strong> donations.
- Opportunities that don't require money require a <strong>significant time commitment</strong>, specifically the sign-up process.
- Navigating volunteering websites and resources is <strong>confusing</strong>.

    TAKEAWAYS
Realized (the hard way) that trying to solve all problems means solving none. It is good practice to identify one core issue and scale it down to something doable.
Successfully extended a product to various media.
Conducted experience-research by attempting the application process ourselves.
Regretted not doing enough user testing.

    RESPONSIBILITIES
