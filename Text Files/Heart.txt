POETRY

January 31st, 2021
Stress 
The sky be held in arms of youthful souls 
      When hail breaks loose and shivers sting like fire.
In awe I gaze, an unforeseen snowstorm, 
      Of childhood past recalled moments retired.

May stress not seize, strangle, subdue my heart, 
      Instead propel thine dreams, be guiding me?
Those sleepless nights shed light, reflected shards 
      Of glass, broken windows, my eyes can’t see.

What pressure stand with I as to become 
      Of greatness if greatness not I they seek? 
Of closed mind, they comply, give time, but hum
      I shall, a melody not nearly bleak.

Be future plans past planned ensuring plight, 
      Unhaply breaks its hope unless I fight.

A Thought that Readily Slips Away V1
It took me a second to realize 
      Her presence that I felt was in a dream.
My worries stall and in dismay I oblige 
      To the cunningness memory teems.

I believed for a long time that my dreaming mind is vacant, 
      And still I do. But that which I recalled can’t have been.
My past and present are all I have to attest, however, so salient 
      Is the falsehood of memory, I now a slave to it.

Vividly, so vividly had I eluded her eyes, 
      In living memory and occasional fantasy.
But I need not let the thought replay like a lullaby, 
      Simply perfect and bijou, so easy to carry.

I must let it slip into my subconscious, 
      And with the present, remember to be cautious.

THE FLARE
A missing piece he says,
That there is a missing piece
A cause-effect explanation was too 'neat'
Am I more cryptic than it seems?

The flare kindled in seconds
And is still alive, to my surprise
What a wonderful thing, to have such
	      an intensity of parity surviving

You read into me too deep at times
Better do you notice what gathered
      dust in those shelves of files
To build a picture of mosaic and tile
--
There are details I’d rather omit
Parts of the story I continue to deal with
I’m “falling” into them, if you wish
	      to use such a word to describe it

Would telling you that I’ve fallen
	      in love suffice?
Or are you alluding to another fragment?
One that slipped passed my pastiche?

I’ve morphed to appease the 
	      demands of a temporary circumstance
And do not know by what end I’ll morph back
Or if these changes will surface an aching of past

#EAEAEA
n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.
